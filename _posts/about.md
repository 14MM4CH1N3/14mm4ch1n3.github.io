# Hello

- I'm Nate
- Maybe I'll update this page more in the future when I have a real career, I'm currently in my last semester of college studying Cybersecurity 
- I enjoy all sorts of technology
    - Especially learning new things about it
    - Cybersecurity is super interesting in this aspect
- My main hobby is playing video games, and I generally enjoy everything except for games in the 4X genre
- I like to be very straight and to the point
- My favorite image in the whole world is trollface
